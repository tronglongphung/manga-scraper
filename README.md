As a Manga reader

I WANT an app that can let me read Mangas WITHOUT ADS
SO THAT I can view my Mangas freely

WHEN I click on a Home page
THEN I am presented with a list of Mangas to choose

WHEN I click on a heart button
THEN the manga will be added into the Saved page

WHEN I click on a Manga name
THEN I see the details of that specific Manga and it's chapters

WHEN I click on a Manga chapter
THEN I can read the manga without ADS
